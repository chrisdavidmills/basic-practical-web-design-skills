  <h1>Basic practical web design skills</h1>

<p>Chris Mills, Mozilla</p>

<main>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Web is a good place to begin learning about how technology works, as well as fundamental Information and Communication Technology (ICT) concepts such as programming. It is everywhere and familiar, easy to learn compared to other programming platforms, and there is a lot of help available due to the Web's largely free and open nature.</p>

<p>This course is a practical introduction to web design that focuses on coding skills (read <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~cmills/st-chads/">It's my Web</a> for more theory as well as some practical content).</p>

<p class="note">This course has mainly been written with 10-11 year old children in mind, but anyone who is a complete beginner to web design should be able to get a lot out of it.</p>

<p class="note">Note: if you have any feedback or change requests you want to give about the course, send pull requests/comments to the <a href="https://github.com/chrisdavidmills/basic-practical-web-design-skills">Basic practical web design Github repo</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills">send Chris a message on Twitter</a>.</p>
